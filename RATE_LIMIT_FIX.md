# 🚨 Firebase Rate Limit Error - Complete Fix Guide

## 🎯 **The Problem**
You're getting **"Firebase: Error (auth/too-many-requests)"** because Firebase has a rate limit for sending verification emails. This happens when you try to send too many verification emails in a short period.

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**
- Firebase limits verification emails to prevent spam
- Usually triggered after 3-5 verification email attempts
- Rate limit lasts for about 1 hour
- Common during development/testing

## ✅ **Immediate Solutions (Choose One)**

### **Solution 1: Use Social Login (Recommended)**
**This is the fastest way to get into your app:**

1. **On the verify-email page**, scroll down to see the new social login buttons
2. **Click "Continue with Google"** or **"Continue with Facebook"**
3. **You'll be logged in immediately** - no email verification needed!

### **Solution 2: Wait 1 Hour**
- Wait for 1 hour and try sending verification email again
- The rate limit will reset automatically

### **Solution 3: Check Your Email**
- Check your **spam/junk folder**
- Look for emails from Firebase
- Sometimes emails are delayed or filtered
